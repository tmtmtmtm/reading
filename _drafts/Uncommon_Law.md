## Excerpts:

> “The Reasonable Man is fed and kept alive by the most valued and enduring
> of our juridical institutions—the common jury. Hateful as he must necessarily
> be to any ordinary citizen, it is a curious paradox that where two or three
> are gathered together they pretend an admiration for him; and, when gathered
> together in the formidable surroundings of a British jury, they are each
> and generally, reasonable men.” (p4)

> “a modern parallel may perhaps be found in the statutory regulations of
> many railway companies, whereby, for the purposes of freight, a typewriter
> is counted as a musical instrument” (p5)

> “in general, the conditions of mind most fostered by the news of the day
> are curiosity, cupidity, envy, indignation, horror, and fear.” (p14)

> “It is a principle of English law that a person who appears in a police
> court has done something undesirable, and citizens who do unusual actions
> which attract the attention of the police should be careful to bring these
> actions into one of the recognized categories of crimes and offences, for
> it is intolerable that the police should be put to the pains of inventing
> reasons for finding them undesirable.” (p26)

> “A highbrow is the kind of person who looks at a sausage and thinks of
> Picasso. She thinks life is nothing but a frame for art. You cannot talk
> to her about the weather. She has no soul for detective stories. She cannot
> swim. She reads in the bath. She quotes French writers at breakfast. She
> has just read a book which you have not. She says so.” (p50)

> “Magna Carta must be interpreted in the light of recent statutes, so that
> it reads: 'Nor will we proceed against a freeman, nor condemn him, but by
> lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land, or Government
> Departments, or Marketing Boards, or Impregnable Monopolies, or Trade
> Unions, or fussy Societies, or Licensing Magistrates, or officious policemen,
> or foolish regulations by a Clerk in the Home Office'” (p57)

> “Indeed, it says much for the sincerity with which these colleagues detest
> each other that, rather than share a common bank-balance, they would
> cheerfully continue with thirteen independent overdrafts.” (p60)

> “The evidence on the whole goes to show that a man who has made up his
> mind on a given subject twenty-five years ago and continues to hold his
> political opinions after he has been proved to be wrong is a man of
> principle; while he who from time to time adapts his opinions to the
> changing circumstances of life is an opportunist.” (p61)

> “In the last two puzzles, milord, this unhappy victim of the defendant's
> spite had not even the satisfaction of a principal (and horizontal) place
> in the puzzle, but was degraded to the position of a word in four letters,
> reading downward, an indignity intolerable, milord, to a man of his years
> and sensibility.” (p87)

> “It was held so long ago as 1887 by Mr. Justice Charles that the only right
> of the subject in a public street is to pass at an even pace from one end
> of it to another, breathing unobtrusively through the nose and attracting
> no attention.” (p92)

> “Nothing is more difficult to do than to make a verbal observation which
> will give no offence and bring about more good than harm; and many great
> men die in old age without ever having done it.” (p93)

> “The Foreign Office issues a somewhat peremptory pamphlet entitled 'Passport
> Regulations' in which it is stated that every British subject who leaves
> these shores 'must' do this or that in relation to passports. But unless
> it can be shown that these commands and regulations are made by virtue of
> the Royal prerogative they have no better juridical sanction than the rules
> of grammar or the canons of metrical composition” (p133)

> “It is sometimes backed by the impudent plea that the motorist pays a duty
> which is not borne by the pedestrian. Which is like saying that he who
> pays duties on liquor has a better right to enter a hotel than a teetotaller:
> or that he who pays tobacco-duty is entitled to blow smoke in the face of
> a non-smoker.” (p129)

> “A row of motor-cars is no more entitled to obstruct the pedestrian than
> a row of pedestrians to obstruct the motorist. A man does not, when he
> acquires a pistol or a gun, acquire the right to menace or retard the
> movements of his fellow-citizens: neither does he acquire that right when
> he acquires a powerful motor-car.” (p131)

> The Englishman never enjoys himself except for a noble purpose. He does
> not play cricket because it is a good game, but because it creates good
> citizens. He does not love motor-races for their own sake, but for the 
> advantages they bring to the engineering firms of his country. And it is
> common knowledge that the devoted persons who conduct and regularly attend 
> horse-races do not do so because they like it, but for the benefit of the 
> breed of the English horse. (p198)

> A cheque was admittedly not legal tender in the sense that it could not
> lawfully be refused; but it was accepted by custom as a legitimate form
> of payment. There were funds in his bank sufficient to meet the cow; the
> Commissioners might not like the cow, but, the cow having been tendered,
> they were estopped from charging him with failure to pay. (p203)

> Later he admitted that there might have been present in his mind a
> desire to make the Collector of Taxes ridiculous. But why not? There
> was no law against deriding the income-tax. (p204)
