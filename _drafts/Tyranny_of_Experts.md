## Excerpts:

> “The conventional approach to economic development, to making poor countries
> rich, is based on a technocratic illusion: the belief that poverty is a
> purely technical problem amenable to such technical solutions as fertilizers,
> antibiotics, or nutritional supplements.”

> “What used to be the divine right of kings has in our time become the
> development right of dictators. The implicit vision in development today
> is that of well-intentioned autocrats advised by technical experts, what
> this book will call authoritarian development. ”

> “Morally neutral approaches to poverty do not exist. Any approach to
> development will either respect the rights of the poor or it will violate
> them. One cannot avoid this moral choice by appealing to “nonideological
> evidence-based policies” (a popular phrase in development today).”

> “History and modern experience suggest that free individuals with political
> and economic rights—call it free development—make up a remarkably successful
> problem-solving system. Free development gives us the right to choose
> amongst a myriad of spontaneous problem-solvers, rewarding those that solve
> our problems. These public and private problem-solvers accomplish far more
> than dictators who implement solutions provided by experts.”

> “The technocratic illusion is that poverty results from a shortage of
> expertise, whereas poverty is really about a shortage of rights.”

> “Those who support autocrats in development do not see autocracy as an end
> in itself. They genuinely believe autocrats would deliver the escape from
> poverty faster than free systems will. They believe the experts advising
> the autocrats know better than poor individuals how to solve their problems.”

> “Maybe it really does take autocrats to get things done, to avoid democratic
> stalemates—but they should at least be debated. This book will have that
> debate.”

> “Hayek thought, as did his fellow thinkers on totalitarianism, that
> the relevant spectrum was the individual versus the collective, with
> liberalism at one end and both Fascism and Communism at the other.
> Stalin and Hitler had in common the violent coercion of the individual
> to serve collective ends…It is sadly ironic that the man who helped
> overturn the conventional left–right distinction in the debate on
> individual freedom would be lastingly seen by some as a right-wing
> extremist.”

> “To address the richness of the debate about autocracy versus freedom,
> and to understand why autocracy won in development, it helps to break
> the big idea of autocracy down into three component ideas. We present
> them each here as a dichotomy in which few would be at either extreme:

> 1. The Blank Slate versus learning from history. Is the expert free to
> write upon a “Blank Slate”? Or does each country’s past matter for its
> future

> 2. The well-being of nations versus that of individuals. Is the object of
> development efforts to be the nation or the individual? Is development
> about meeting national goals, or letting individuals choose and meet their
> own goals?

> 3. Conscious design versus spontaneous solutions. Was development the result
> of deliberate design by experts at the center, or did it emerge from
> unplanned solutions by individuals?”

> “Since the Blank Slate ignores the particulars of history in each country,
> and technical experts start from scratch in every country, all poor countries
> seem equivalent. The best example of the pervasive Blank Slate mentality
> in development is the idea of “underdevelopment” itself. Categories like
> “underdeveloped countries” and “the Third World” homogenize otherwise
> diverse countries like China, Colombia, and Benin into one group.”

> “A malleable Blank Slate also fostered a great potential for technocrats
> to create one-size-fits-all fixes that could be applied widely instead of
> having to study the historical context in each instance. It is easy to see
> the appeal of solutions that promised to work everywhere in the Third
> World. ”

> “The objective of development as developing the nation-state—that is,
> development in, by, and for individual countries—is so taken for granted
> that it is rarely even noticed. In the various phrases in development
> discourse— *developing countries*, *underdeveloped countries*, 
> *Third World countries*—the discussion is usually about which modifier 
> to use while the word *countries* is never questioned.”
