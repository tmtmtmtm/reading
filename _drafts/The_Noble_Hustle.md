## Excerpts:

> “In one of the fiction-writing manuals, it says that there are only two
> stories: a hero goes on a journey, and a stranger comes to town. I don’t
> know. This being life, and not literature, we’ll have to make do with this:
> A middle-aged man, already bowing and half broken under his psychic burdens,
> decides to take on the stress of being one of the most unqualified players
> in the history of the Big Game. A hapless loser goes on a journey, a strange
> man comes to gamble.”
