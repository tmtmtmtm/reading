## Excerpts:

> “In one of the fiction-writing manuals, it says that there are only two
> stories: a hero goes on a journey, and a stranger comes to town. I don’t
> know. This being life, and not literature, we’ll have to make do with this:
> A middle-aged man, already bowing and half broken under his psychic burdens,
> decides to take on the stress of being one of the most unqualified players
> in the history of the Big Game. A hapless loser goes on a journey, a strange
> man comes to gamble.”

> “Growing up in the city, I never went to a lot of malls, so I didn’t have
> the psychological scars of my Midwestern friends, who cringed at the thought
> of all the adolescent afternoons spent mindlessly drifting across the
> buffed tile. I like the Leisure Industrial Complex when I can find it,
> those meticulously arranged consumer arenas. I don’t care if it’s a suburban
> galleria sucking the human plankton into itself from the exit ramps or a
> metro-area monolith stuffed with escalators to convey the herd to the
> multiple price-pointed retail outlets, food court stalls, and movie screens.”

> “My bed was impossibly stiff, as if all the years of bad luck in this
> place, the busted hopes and evaporated rent money, had been turned into
> cement, cut into slabs, and then wheeled down the carpeted hallways into
> the rooms. ”

> “Whoever invented poker was bright,” the saying goes, “but whoever invented
> chips was genius.” Uncouple cash money from its conventional associations,
> and people gamble more freely. Sure, green cash is already a metaphor, but
> the real pain of seeing actual money disappear into a lost pot is not. No
> longer milk, meat, and rent, the plastic tokens are tiny slivers chipped
> off an abstraction, an index of two things: Time and Power.”

> “The more chips you have, the longer you can play. But a tournament has
> more hyperinflation than a CIA-toppled banana republic. As in real life,
> chips don’t buy as much as they used to as time goes by. The blinds are
> escalating every level—$300 and $600, $500 and $1,000 blinds, $3,000 and
> $6,000. Your stack becomes more worthless every hand. The more chips you
> accumulate, the more Time you have left. At the final WSOP table in 2010,
> the chip leader had $65 million in chips. What is that in Time? Empires
> rise and fall in that interval.”

> “As it turned out, one aspect of my personality would help me in my odyssey:
> I was a bider. Temperamentally suited to hold out for good cards, well
> accustomed to waiting. We Anhedonians have adapted to long periods between
> good news. Our national animal is the hope camel. We have no national bird.
> All the birds are dead.”
