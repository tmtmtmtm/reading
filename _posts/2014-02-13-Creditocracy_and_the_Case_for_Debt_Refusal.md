## Review:
<div class="review">
I'm very confused as to who the expected audience for this book is meant to be. It's been described as a “movement book”, that is “lucid and accessible”, but it's the densest book I've read in quite some time. (HemingwayApp gives the first chapter's reading level as Grade 18, with 55% of sentences at post-college-level “Very Hard to Read”, and a further 20% at  college-level “Hard to Read”. The remaining 25% of ‘simple’ sentences are either quotes, or tend towards “This reshuffling of the merits attached to citizenly conduct is quite telling” or “The first structural adjustment loan was made shortly after Volcker’s monetary shock therapy.”)<br /><br />The book claims to be “a work of moral commentary and political advocacy, not academic analysis”, but unless it's trying merely to persuade his fellow university professors, I'm far from convinced it'll make much of a dent at all.
