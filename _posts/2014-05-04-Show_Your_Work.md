## Review:

Lots of good ideas, but a little too rapid-fire, with not enough depth. Much of the book went through the "tweet → blog post → book chapter" cycle, but it could do with another pass to flesh the ideas out more, particularly towards the end when the average chapter length drops to under 300 words!
