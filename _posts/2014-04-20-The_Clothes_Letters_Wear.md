## Review:
<div class="review">
This was <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/insigne/the-clothes-letters-wear" rel="nofollow">a kickstarter project</a> to create a book that introduced typography and fonts to young children. This is done as a picture-book of a series of rhyming couplets for letter pairs; for example "Elegant E enjoys the past, while F has chosen something fast", with a large E in an 1800's Woodtype font and F in Futuristic Oblique. With each letter appearing in three different fonts on each page (a sans-serif single-letter title; the serifed ryhme; and the giant "clothed" stylised letter) there's lots of scope for explaining to children what makes each the same but different. <br /><br />Unfortunately, although the concept is well executed from a lettering point of view, the verse that provides the "story" of the book is very clumsy, with constantly-changing metre and some painfully forced rhymes. My suspicion is that this will largely be a book that parents impose on their children, rather than one they keep asking to come back to.
