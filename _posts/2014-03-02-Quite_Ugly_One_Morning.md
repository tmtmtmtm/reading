## Review:
<div class="review">
A key point revolves around encrypted documents needing to be re-encrypted once they've been unlocked, else they'll now be permanently open again. Did any software <em>really</em> work like that (circa. 1996), or is this just a sloppy plot device? (Plus a “Silicone Valley” that's managed to survive to my 14th-printing copy.)
