## Review:
<div class="review">
I've enjoyed the long-form Mary Roach books I've previously read, but this format (750-word essays for Readers Digest) doesn't really work so well. There are the occasional funny or insightful lines, but for even the best pieces, just as they show signs of having promise, they're over.
