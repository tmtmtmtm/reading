## Review:
<div class="review">
Despite his having written about 1000 short-stories, I'd never previously heard of Hoch until I read his afterward to <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15745277.Ehrengraf_for_the_Defense" title="Ehrengraf for the Defense by Lawrence Block">Ehrengraf for the Defense</a>. Thankfully several collections of his stories are available for free on <a href="http://www.scribd.com/g/41059d" rel="nofollow">Scribd Premium</a>[1]. This set are about Nick Velvet — a thief who steals to order, no questions asked (but only items of no value), for a flat fee of $20,000 a time ($30k if it's likely to be especially dangerous). Most of the time, in order to successfully actually carry out the theft, or in order to protect himself from being double-crossed (or even killed), he to figure out what's <em>really</em> going on, and ends up acting as as much of a detective as a thief (with shades of <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/series/40960-bernie-rhodenbarr">Bernie Rhodenbarr</a>). The stories are generally quick and fun, and now the completist is me is wondering how to find copies of all the ones that <em>haven't</em> been anthologised!<br /><br /><em>[1] Sign up with this link for two months free, and I get a bonus month. </em>
