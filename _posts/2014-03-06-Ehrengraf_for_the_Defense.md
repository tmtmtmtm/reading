## Review:
<div class="review">
Was previously unaware of this Block series, but found it for free in the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/g/41059d" rel="nofollow">Scribd subscription service</a> [this link gets us both a free month if you want to try it out].<br /><br />A criminal lawyer (in both senses) who takes cases on a no-win, no-fee basis, and then does <em>anything</em> to make sure he collects. A nice, typically Block-ian premise, well executed, although as a collection of short-stories it not only tends to become a little repetitive after a while, but doesn't give much scope for digging more deeply into the character. Would be great to see a more Keller-esque follow-up, rather than just a few more shorts.<br />
