## Review:
<div class="review">
Chris Morris is an elusive and reclusive figure, who almost never gives interviews, or explains what he was trying to achieve. Oddly, Randall is able to explicitly note this is because Morris doesn't want to <em>be</em> the story himself, whilst simultaneously making this book just that, being unwilling or unable to push it anywhere beyond the dull recitation of mundane minutiae. <br /><br />The book notes several times that the UK media never adequately engaged suitably with Brass Eye or Morris: “There was a debate to be had, about the show as well as the issues it raised,  but the media largely plugged itself straight back into the incoherent rage of the previous summer." But Randall does no better, retreating instead into a procession of often half-remembered trivialities (“In the summer of his third year Morris produced a project on lizards under the general supervision of tutor Roger Avery, who can now recall little detail of either the work or the student who produced it.”)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16166062.Chaos_Magic_Music_Money" title="Chaos Magic Music Money by J.M.R. Higgs">Chaos Magic Music Money</a> has shown perfectly how to write this sort of book. Now it just needs someone to do so.
