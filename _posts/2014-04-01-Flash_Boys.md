## Review:
<div class="review">
Lewis keeps getting better at making complex financial systems understandable ... and also conveying why it's important to understand them. I was aware of some of the underlying technology issues around the race to shave microseconds off trading times from reading <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13542772.Automate_This__How_Algorithms_Came_to_Rule_Our_World" title="Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World by Christopher Steiner">Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World</a>, but Lewis does a great job of highlighting not just the technical arms-race, but the repercussions of it. <br /><br />In particular he draws out how most financial regulation is The Law of Unintended Consequences writ large, again and again and again — where a law passed to stamp out one abuse simply creates a new loophole to be exploited by someone else. Or, as John Schwall puts it: “The entire history of Wall Street was the story of scandals, linked together tail to trunk like circus elephants.”<br /><br />This is the story of how one group set out to create a trading system that is impossible to abuse (or at least impossible to <em>secretly</em> abuse), and then persuade everyone to use it, against what might appear to be their vested interests. It's not only paced like a high-tech thriller, but also raises many interesting questions (particularly for those of us who work in transparency-related fields) about the risks involved in getting such systems wrong:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />“You do nothing, and everyone does what they want,” said Brad. “You do something and you can influence behavior. But, by creating the tool, do we incentivize behavior we want to eliminate? By shining the light, do we create a gray zone, just outside the light? [Do] you create the very thing you’re trying to get rid of?”<br /><br />“Shining a light creates shadows,” said Don. “If you try to create this bright line, you are going to create gray zones on either side.”<br /></blockquote>
