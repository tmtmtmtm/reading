## Review:
<div class="review">
Westlake inverts the usual caper formula, when a prisoner who just wants an easy life gets caught up with a gang trying to rob a bank, and has to keep finding ways of stopping them, whilst making them think he's completely behind the idea.  The writing isn't as polished as his best works, but it's a fun story.
