## Excerpts:

> “In one of the fiction-writing manuals, it says that there are only two
> stories: a hero goes on a journey, and a stranger comes to town. I don’t
> know. This being life, and not literature, we’ll have to make do with this:
> A middle-aged man, already bowing and half broken under his psychic burdens,
> decides to take on the stress of being one of the most unqualified players
> in the history of the Big Game. A hapless loser goes on a journey, a strange
> man comes to gamble.”

> “Growing up in the city, I never went to a lot of malls, so I didn’t have
> the psychological scars of my Midwestern friends, who cringed at the thought
> of all the adolescent afternoons spent mindlessly drifting across the
> buffed tile. I like the Leisure Industrial Complex when I can find it,
> those meticulously arranged consumer arenas. I don’t care if it’s a suburban
> galleria sucking the human plankton into itself from the exit ramps or a
> metro-area monolith stuffed with escalators to convey the herd to the
> multiple price-pointed retail outlets, food court stalls, and movie screens.”

> “My bed was impossibly stiff, as if all the years of bad luck in this
> place, the busted hopes and evaporated rent money, had been turned into
> cement, cut into slabs, and then wheeled down the carpeted hallways into
> the rooms. ”

> “Whoever invented poker was bright,” the saying goes, “but whoever invented
> chips was genius.” Uncouple cash money from its conventional associations,
> and people gamble more freely. Sure, green cash is already a metaphor, but
> the real pain of seeing actual money disappear into a lost pot is not. No
> longer milk, meat, and rent, the plastic tokens are tiny slivers chipped
> off an abstraction, an index of two things: Time and Power.”

> “The more chips you have, the longer you can play. But a tournament has
> more hyperinflation than a CIA-toppled banana republic. As in real life,
> chips don’t buy as much as they used to as time goes by. The blinds are
> escalating every level—$300 and $600, $500 and $1,000 blinds, $3,000 and
> $6,000. Your stack becomes more worthless every hand. The more chips you
> accumulate, the more Time you have left. At the final WSOP table in 2010,
> the chip leader had $65 million in chips. What is that in Time? Empires
> rise and fall in that interval.”

> “As it turned out, one aspect of my personality would help me in my odyssey:
> I was a bider. Temperamentally suited to hold out for good cards, well
> accustomed to waiting. We Anhedonians have adapted to long periods between
> good news. Our national animal is the hope camel. We have no national bird.
> All the birds are dead.”

> “The Alabama in her voice was strong. She’d made no effort to shed her
> Southern accent during her time in the city. I respected that, as I’d
> worked hard over the years to flatten my Anhedonian accent, which one
> linguist memorably described as ‘like a flock of geese getting beaten by
> tire irons.’”

> “Coach gave me Harrington homework, and I made slow but incremental progress
> through his strategies for satellites, internet tourneys, and brick-and-mortar
> showdowns. His words yielded new interpretations over time, like a really
> neat poem or a divorce settlement… Harrington hipped innocents like me to the 
> late-stage tourney mind-set and late-hand strategies, giving names to that 
> which I understood only on a subconscious level.”

> “Pick your fights like you pick your nose: with complete awareness of where
> you are.”

> “I’d long aspired to the laid-back lifestyle of exhibits at Madame Tussaud’s.
> There are cool perks. You don’t have to move around that much or waste
> energy on fake smiles, and every now and then someone shows up to give you
> a good dusting.”

> “Poker was the perfect game for me, as I didn’t have to speak. It was like
> Disneyland for hermits. I had found the place where I could go out among
> the humans, elbow to elbow for hours, and not say a fucking word. It brought
> me back to the old days, when I first started to write, and I’d spend whole
> days shut up in my apartment and the only thing I’d say to another living
> being was ‘… and a pack of Winston Lights.’”

> “The world is a disease you shake off in the desert. To delude yourself
> that you are a human being with thoughts and feelings, when your experience
> is but the shadow of truly living—it moves me to tears. Although I should
> note that in Anhedonian, the word tears means “to shrug in a distinctive
> ‘well, what are you gonna do?’ fashion,” and has nothing to do with lachrymal
> fluids produced by glands in the eye.”

> “We live in an age in which sitcoms outnumber miracles, and perhaps that
> is what we deserve. ”

> “Exploitive play asked, How can I take advantage of this situation? The
> optimum play of Math Players inquires, What is the correct play for this
> situation? Super-aggressive chest-thumping before the flop, like sociopathic
> raising and re-raising when all you have is 9-3 offsuit, will fatten your
> stack as long as you can scare people off. But eventually exploitative
> players will have to duel through the Flop, the Turn, and the River, and
> they’ll need a deeper tool kit. The Math Players insist that over time,
> sticking to a solid core strategy will maximize profits.”

> “Stu Ungar once said to me, “Sexton, always remember this: All two aces
> are good for is to win a small pot or lose a big one.”

> “You can sort players into dependable categories. Tight is conservative.
> Loose plays a lot of hands. Loose-Aggressive plays a lot of hands, plays
> a lot of shit, but will bully you with betting. At the first table, I
> played something that might be called Tight-Incompetent.”

> “I’d seen someone on Coach’s poker feed say that hubris is the short stack
> ordering a massage.”
