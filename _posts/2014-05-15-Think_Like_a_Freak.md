## Excerpts:

> If asked how we’d behave in a situation that pits a private benefit against
> the greater good, most of us won’t admit to favoring the private benefit.
> But as history clearly shows, most people, whether because of nature or
> nurture, generally put their own interests ahead of others’. This doesn’t
> make them bad people; it just makes them human.

> It strikes us that in recent years, the idea has arisen that there is a
> “right” way to think about solving a given problem and of course a “wrong”
> way too. This inevitably leads to a lot of shouting—and, sadly, a lot of
> unsolved problems. Can this situation be improved upon? We hope so. We’d
> like to bury the idea that there’s a right way and a wrong way, a smart
> way and a foolish way, a red way and a blue way. The modern world demands
> that we all think a bit more productively, more creatively, more rationally;
> that we think from a different angle, with a different set of muscles,
> with a different set of expectations; that we think with neither fear nor
> favor, with neither blind optimism nor sour skepticism. That we think
> like—ahem—a Freak.

> Our first two books were animated by a relatively simple set of
> ideas:

> * Incentives are the cornerstone of modern life.

> * Knowing what to measure, and how to measure it, can make a complicated world less so.

> * The conventional wisdom is often wrong

> * Correlation does not equal causality

> Another barrier to thinking like a Freak is that most people are too busy
> to rethink the way they think—or to even spend much time thinking at all.
> When was the last time you sat for an hour of pure, unadulterated thinking?

> One thing we’ve learned is that when people, especially politicians, start
> making decisions based on a reading of their moral compass, facts tend to
> be among the first casualties.

> The world is also thick with “entrepreneurs of error,” as the economist
> Edward Glaeser calls them, political and religious and business leaders
> who “supply beliefs when it will increase their own financial or political
> returns.

> When asked to name the attributes of someone who is particularly bad at
> predicting, Tetlock needed just one word. ‘Dogmatism.’

> As two psychologists recently put it in an academic journal: “Despite
> spending more time with themselves than with any other person, people often
> have surprisingly poor insight into their skills and abilities.”

> Just because you’re great at something doesn’t mean you’re good at
> everything. Unfortunately, this fact is routinely ignored by those who
> engage in—take a deep breath—ultracrepidarianism, or “the habit of giving
> opinions and advice on matters outside of one’s knowledge or competence.

> Voting may be one of the sloppiest feedback loops around, but it is feedback
> nonetheless.

> If it takes a lot of courage to admit you don’t know all the answers, just
> imagine how hard it is to admit you don’t even know the right question.

> Most people don’t have the time or inclination to think very hard about
> big problems. We tend to pay attention to what other people say and, 
> if their views resonate with us, we slide our perception atop theirs.
> Furthermore, we tend to focus on the part of a problem that *bothers* us.

> It wasn’t exactly rocket science, but then his competitors weren’t rocket
> scientists either.

> In recent experiments, scientists have found that even elite athletes can
> be tricked into improvement by essentially lying to them. In one experiment,
> cyclists were told to pedal a stationary bike at top speed for the equivalent
> of 4,000 meters. Later they repeated the task while watching an avatar of
> themselves pedaling in the earlier time trial. What the cyclists didn’t
> know was that the researchers had turned up the speed on the avatar. And
> yet the cyclists were able to keep up with their avatars, surpassing what
> they thought had been their top speed.

> It took years for the ulcer proof to fully take hold, for conventional
> wisdom dies hard. Even today, many people still believe that ulcers are
> caused by stress or spicy foods. Fortunately, doctors now know better. The
> medical community finally came to acknowledge that while everyone else was
> simply treating the symptoms of an ulcer, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren
> had uncovered its root cause. In 2005, they were awarded the Nobel Prize.
> The ulcer discovery, stunning as it was, constitutes just one small step
> in a revolution that is only beginning to unfold, a revolution aimed toward
> finding the root cause of illness rather than simply swatting away symptoms.

> By one estimate, the human body contains ten times as many microbial cells
> as human cells, which puts the number easily in the trillions and perhaps
> in the quadrillions. This “microbial cloud,” as the biologist Jonathan
> Eisen calls it, is so vast that some scientists consider it the largest
> organ in the human body. And within it may lie the root of much human
> health ... or illness.

> In one small study, Borody claims to have used fecal transplants to
> effectively cure people who were suffering from ulcerative colitis—which,
> he says, was “previously an incurable disease.

> Consider the kind of questions that kids ask. Sure, they may be silly or
> simplistic or out of bounds. But kids are also relentlessly curious and
> relatively unbiased. Because they know so little, they don’t carry around
> the preconceptions that often stop people from seeing things as they are.
> When it comes to solving problems, this is a big advantage. Preconceptions
> lead us to rule out a huge set of possible solutions simply because they
> seem unlikely or repugnant; because they don’t pass the smell test or have
> never been tried; because they don’t seem sophisticated enough.

> If you meet someone who fancies himself a thought leader or an intellectual,
> one of the nicest compliments you can pay is to call him a “big thinker.”
> Go ahead, try it, and watch him swell with pride. If he does, we can
> virtually guarantee you he has no interest in thinking like a Freak.  To
> think like a Freak means to think small, not big.

> There are certain realms in which having fun, or even looking like you’re
> having fun, is practically forbidden. Politics, for one; academia too. And
> while some firms have lately been spicing things up with gamification,
> most of the business world remains allergic to fun.

> From what we’ve seen personally, the best predictor of success among young
> economists and journalists is whether they absolutely love what they do.
> If they approach their job like—well, a job—they aren’t likely to thrive.
> But if they’ve somehow convinced themselves that running regressions or
> interviewing strangers is the funnest thing in the world, you know they
> have a shot.

> Very often,” Cialdini says, “public-service messages are designed to move
> people in societally desirable directions by telling them how many people
> are behaving in undesirable directions. 
> *So many people are drinking and driving—we have to stop this.*
> *Teenage pregnancy is so prevalent in our schools—we have to do something about this.* 
> *Tax fraud is so rampant that we have to increase the penalties for it.* 
> It’s very human but it’s a wrong-headed strategy, because the subtext
> message is that a lot of people just like you are doing this. It
> legitimizes the undesirable behavior.

> He also wanted to change the face of the non-profit industry itself, “the
> most dysfunctional $300 billion industry in the world,” as he saw it.
> Mullaney had come to believe that too many philanthropists engage in what
> Peter Buffett, a son of the über-billionaire Warren Buffett, calls “conscience
> laundering”—doing charity to make themselves feel better rather than
> fighting to figure out the best ways to alleviate suffering.

> Backfiring bounties are, sadly, not as rare as one might hope. This
> phenomenon is sometimes called “the cobra effect.” As the story goes, a
> British overlord in colonial India thought there were far too many cobras
> in Delhi. So he offered a cash bounty for every cobra skin. The incentive
> worked well—so well, in fact, that it gave rise to a new industry: cobra
> farming. Indians began to breed, raise, and slaughter the snakes to take
> advantage of the bounty. Eventually the bounty was rescinded—whereupon the
> cobra farmers did the logical thing and set their snakes free.

> It’s easy to envision how you’d change the behavior of people who think
> just like you do, but the people whose behavior you’re trying to change
> often don’t think like you—and, therefore, don’t respond as you might
> expect.

> Roughly 95 percent of the burglar alarms that U.S. police respond to are
> false alarms. That makes for a total of 36 million false positives a year,
> at a cost of nearly $2 billion.

> As hard as it is to think creatively about problems and come up with
> solutions, in our experience it is even harder to persuade people who do
> not wish to be persuaded.

> What about all the people who drive for a living? Nearly 3 percent of
> the U.S. workforce—about 3.6 million people—feed their families by driving
> taxis, ambulances, buses, delivery trucks, tractor-trailers, and other
> vehicles. What are they supposed to do when [self-driving] technology
> obliterates their livelihood?

> When failure is demonized, people will try to avoid it at all costs—even
> when it represents nothing more than a temporary setback.

> What if there were a way to peek around the corner on any project to see
> if it’s destined to fail—that is, if you could learn how you might fail
> without going to the trouble of actually failing?  That’s the idea behind
> a “premortem,” as the psychologist Gary Klein calls it. The idea is simple.
> Many institutions already conduct a postmortem on failed projects, hoping
> to learn exactly what killed the patient. A premortem tries to find out
> what might go wrong before it’s too late. You gather up everyone connected
> with a project and have them imagine that it launched and failed miserably.
> Now they each write down the exact reasons for its failure. Klein has found
> the premortem can help flush out the flaws or doubts in a project that no
> one had been willing to speak aloud.  This suggests one way to make a
> premortem even more useful: offer anonymity.

> Winston Churchill, despite his famous advice to those Harrow schoolboys,
> was in fact one of history’s greatest quitters. Soon after entering politics
> he quit one party for another, and later he quit government altogether.
> When he rejoined, he quit parties again. And when he wasn’t quitting, he
> was getting tossed out. He spent years in the political wilderness,
> denouncing Britain’s appeasement of the Nazis, and was returned to office
> only when that policy’s failure had led to total war. Even in the bleakest
> moments, Churchill did not back down one inch from Hitler; he became “the
> greatest of all Britain’s war leaders,” as the historian John Keegan put
> it. Perhaps it was that long streak of quitting that helped Churchill build
> the fortitude to tough it out when it was truly necessary. By now, he knew
> what was worth letting go, and what was not.
