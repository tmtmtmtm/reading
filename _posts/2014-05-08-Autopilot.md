## Excerpts
> “Every time management book on the market claims that you can and should
> get more done. The message of this book is the opposite. You should get
> less done; in fact you should be idle.” (p7)

> “During Confucian times idleness wasn’t a sub-culture but an integral part
> of the culture. A Confucian gentleman grew long fingernails to prove that
> he did not have to work with his hands. Confucianism actually disdained
> hard work and instead idealized leisure and effortlessness.” (p19)

> “The highest philosophical principle of Taoism is wu-wei, or non-effort,
> which means that a truly enlightened person either spiritually or
> intellectually goes about life with the minimum expenditure of
> energy.” (p19)

> “With the advent of the 1980s and Ronald Reagan, the mantra that productivity
> was essential to self-esteem took hold. It was good for America, it was
> good for business. Laziness, on the other hand, was anti-American.”
> (p21)

> “The discovery of a resting state network in the brain is very recent. It
> has been likened to the discovery of the pervasive “dark energy” in the
> universe.” (p37)

> “When you leave important parts of your brain unattended by relaxing in
> the grass on a sunny afternoon, the parts of your brain in the default
> mode network become more organized and engaged. In your brain, the dishes
> do wash themselves if you just leave them alone. It turns out your brain
> is never idle. In fact, it may work harder when you’re not working at
> all.” (p38)

> “If ten thousand hours of practice are needed to become an expert violinist,
> how many hours of being idle are required to become a master idler?”
> (p46)

> “The trick is learning to embrace, defend, and demand the right to laziness
> as a prerequisite for a good life and a healthy society, and also recognizing
> that the astounding insights that may occur from those who have a particularly
> robust default mode network are not anomalies, but the norm.” (p59)

> “Just as muscles need time to recover after exercise, our brains need time
> to recover after engagement with the external world.” (p74)

> “Human beings are actually terrible at specialization. This is why every
> attempt to turn human beings into worker insects results in massive human
> misery.” (p88)

> “Nowhere in [David] Allen’s imperative to “become a wizard of productivity”
> does he suggest that if you must rely on perpetual mnemonic and digital
> gymnastics to get through your day, maybe you have too much to do.”
> (p94)

> “The great thing about our brains is that they have evolved to find signals
> and truth without any real effort on our part. In fact our brains do a
> better job of finding our own truth if we are idle.” (p98)

> “The only system we know of in the universe that can be innovative is the
> human brain. But the brain seems to need things like freedom, long periods
> of idleness, positive emotions, low stress, randomness, noise, and a group
> of friends with tea in the garden to be creative.” (p123)

> “To the ancient Greeks, anyone who had to work to make a living was
> considered a slave. In modern society almost everyone has to work to make
> a living because we all owe someone money, or expect a bill to come due
> in the near future.” (p129)
