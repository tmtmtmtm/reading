## Review:
<div class="review">
I've lost count of how many times de Bono has written essentially the same book, but that's OK, because it's a good one, and there's always a slightly different angle to it.<br /><br />This time around I was particularly taken by three ideas:<br /><br />1) Units of measurement allow us to avoid errors of magnitude in our thinking (The truth of “Daddy has caught a fish — we can all eat it for dinner” depends greatly on the size of fish caught). In many cases, we use different names for the same thing depending on size. But for things like love, justice, power, etc., we tend to use the same term in many different ways and so constantly get magnitude errors.<br /><br />2) The “press-button idiom”, where getting the result you want is a matter of pressing the correct button on a box, has taken over from the “cause-and-effect” idiom of watching how things happen. This may be the most important cultural change in thinking in the last few centuries.<br /><br />3) We are generally encouraged to value precision in our thinking, and in how we express that thinking. But often a vaguer understanding or expression can be <em>more</em> useful, particularly when you don’t have enough information yet to even ask the correct questions. Early commitment to a specific idea is often dangerous (it's is generally easier to move forward from an incorrect vague idea than to first have to move back from an incorrect detailed one), and blurry concepts keep your options open longer. “The sharp-brained outlook can never establish new ideas because it does not mess around, never makes mistakes, and is completely trapped by existing ideas. … Sharp brains are indeed essential, but only for refining, developing and using the ideas thrown up by the blurry-brained thinking.”<br />
