## Review:
<div class="review">
Once I saw this guy on a bridge about to jump. I said, "Don't do it!" <br /><br />He said, "Nobody loves me." I said, "God loves you. Do you believe in God?"<br /><br />He said, "Yes." I said, "Are you a Christian or a Jew?" <br /><br />He said, "A Christian." I said, "Me, too! Protestant or Catholic?" <br /><br />He said, "Protestant." I said, "Me, too! What franchise?" <br /><br />He said, "Baptist." I said, "Me, too! Northern Baptist or Southern Baptist?" <br /><br />He said, "Northern Baptist." I said, "Me, too! Northern Conservative Baptist or Northern Liberal Baptist?"<br /><br />He said, "Northern Conservative Baptist." I said, "Me, too! Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region, or Northern Conservative Baptist Eastern Region?" <br /><br />He said, "Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region." I said, "Me, too! Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1879, or Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912?"<br /><br />He said, "Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912." I said, "Die, heretic!" <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/sep/29/comedy.religion" rel="nofollow">And I pushed him over.</a><br />
