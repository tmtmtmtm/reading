## Review:
<div class="review">
If this book had been “Gamification: You're Doing it Wrong!” it could have been excellent. Burke does a great job of providing a catalogue of mistakes organisations regularly make in adding gamification to their products or services, and in distilling key reasons such processes regularly fail: <br /><br />• Thinking gamification is about fun. <em>(“Fun is the primary currency of games. Things are the primary currency of rewards programs. Self-esteem and social capital are the primary rewards of gamified solutions.”)</em><br />• Failing to distinguish between emotional engagement and transactional engagement. <em>(“Games primarily engage players on a whimsical level to entertain them. Rewards programs primarily engage players on a transactional level to compensate them. Gamification engages players on an emotional level to motivate them.”)</em><br />• Trying to motivate people to achieve your organisational goals, rather their personal ones. <em>(“Don’t mistake business goals for player goals. The organization’s goals are a by-product. If the player’s goals are aligned with the organization’s goals, then the organizational goals will be achieved as a consequence of the player achieving her goals.”)</em><br /><br />But when it comes to showing examples of doing it well, the book falls short. (Deciding whether that's down to poor writing or an undersupply of good examples to write about can be left as an exercise for the reader...) And so we're given a supply of seeming success stories, but where the gamification aspect actually has very little to do with it — such as Khan Academy, where almost all the key positives listed are to do with the core structure of their teaching approach, rather than the later addition of "energy points" and badges), or Barclaycard Ring, where the implementation of a customer-chosen late-fee policy has less to do with any gamification elements than simply seeking customer input to the process. <br /><br />Similarly, the extended fictionalised walk-through of a player-centric design process was largely uncompelling — though it does provide a handy chart of the key continuum-based parameters that should be carefully considered for each approach: <br /><br /><img src="http://www.tmtm.com/PEM.png" width="312" height="132" alt="Player Engagement Model" class="escapedImg" /><br /><br />The book ends with the author's vision of what effects gamification might have during the remainder of the decade — including in public policy, giving examples in participatory budgeting and Citizens Initiative lawmaking.<br /><br />Again, however, the author seems to be over-enthusiastic in conflating the concepts:<br /><blockquote>Recently, government have been devolving some of the decision-making power to the people they represent. The moves are small ... and it is moving in the right direction, but more can be done. Governments still maintain full control over citizen participation. Public servants need to recognize that it’s not their government. The role of government must be to facilitate the development of public policy by the stakeholders and citizens. This is where gamification can play a role in addressing wicked problems. Rather than having government design policy solutions to wicked problems, it needs to design gamified solutions that will enable policy development by the stakeholders and citizens. Only then will collaborative solutions for wicked problems emerge with the broad support of stakeholders and citizens, thus ensuring that public support is in place for politicians to risk supporting legislative change.</blockquote><br /><br />I'm all for meaningful, engaged, participation. And gamification <em>might</em> indeed be one way to achieve that. But not all such participation is gamification, and the case for making gamification a key component of government is far from made. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
